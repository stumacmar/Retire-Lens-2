## Project Overview

RetireLens 2 is a UK retirement planning engine answering: "Can I retire at age X with £Y net income?" It runs 100% client-side in the browser with no backend.

## Tech Stack

- Pure JavaScript ES6 modules (no framework, no build step)
- Chart.js for visualization
- Playwright for E2E tests
- Deployed via GitHub Pages

## Architecture

- `engine/` — Pure, stateless calculation functions (tax, projections, Monte Carlo, withdrawals). No UI or DOM access.
- `config/` — UK tax rates (2025/26), pension rules, scenario presets.
- `ui/` — Components, screens, export modules. All DOM interaction lives here.
- `src/ux/` — UX orchestration: pathfinder triage, user journeys, onboarding flow.
- `js/app.js` — Main application orchestrator (2700 lines, monolithic).
- `index.html` — Entry point, screen markup.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:all     # All unit tests (7 suites)
npm run test:stress  # 100-scenario stress test (630 assertions)
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright E2E (requires: npx playwright install)
npm run dev          # Dev server on :8080
```

All test files use custom runners (not Jest) via `node tests/<file>.js`.

## Key Conventions

- Engine functions are pure — no side effects, no DOM access.
- State objects are frozen with `Object.freeze()`.
- Monte Carlo uses seeded PRNG (Mulberry32) for reproducibility.
- Tax calculations reference `config/defaults.js` for all UK thresholds.
- PCLS (tax-free cash) is a balance-sheet transfer, not income.
- Couples get independent personal allowances and tax bands.

## Common Pitfalls

- The Monte Carlo simulation must match the deterministic engine when volatility=0. Both paths must apply: mid-year contribution growth, state pension real growth (triple lock), DB pension escalation, and age-adjusted spending.
- Scottish tax bands are separate from England/Wales/NI bands.
- ISA annual cap (£20k) constrains PCLS reinvestment.
